      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring software developer and an avid surfer. I have recently decided to change career paths and I am cery excited about the possibilities of working in tech. For the past 4 years I have been working as a dive instructor in Honduras and Hawaii and it has been an unbelievable experience. My goal is to be able to return to the island life soon, but this time with a rewarding career and potential for growth.
